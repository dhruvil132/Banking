Presentation tier:
Communicates with other two tiers and holds GUI. It is built with Angular, HTML, CSS, and a TypeScript as a front-end logic. Communication with the other tiers is established through API calls.

Application tier:
Handles application logic. It is built in .net core (written in C#). Their primary purpose is to support the applicationâ€™s core functions and fetch/post user data from databases throughout database server calls.

Data tier:
Stores user related information. The data tier consists of a one database servers:

MySQL server and corresponding database, as far as MySQL DBMS. It is used to store users information, their bank account details and all related transaction details.
